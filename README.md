# 🖥️ Linux Terminal Emulator
A simple Linux terminal emulator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This project aims to simulate a basic Linux shell environment in the browser and is intended primarily for educational and demonstration purposes.

🔗 **[Live Demo](https://balestruci0o.github.io/Linux-Terminal-Emulator/)**  

## ✨ Features
Command-line interface with basic command support

* In-browser Linux-like terminal behavior
* Virtual file system simulation
* Common commands like ls, cd, echo, clear, and more
* Responsive design with a clean and minimal UI

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
